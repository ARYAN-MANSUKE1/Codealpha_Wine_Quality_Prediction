# 🍷 Wine Quality Prediction - CodeAlpha Internship Task

This project analyzes the physicochemical properties of red wine and uses machine learning to predict its quality score.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Wine Quality Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009)

## 🔧 Tools Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn

## ✅ What I Did
- Loaded & cleaned the dataset
- Explored key wine features like acidity, alcohol, sulphates
- Visualized correlations and trends
- Trained a RandomForestClassifier
- Achieved ~66% accuracy on wine quality prediction

## 📌 Task Info
This is Task 3 of the CodeAlpha Data Science Internship
